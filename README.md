# JLED
Arduino-based controller for individually addressable LED strips via serial (or mqtt, see other branches). Mostly just a personal project that i abandoned when i discovered WLED


This code is not actively updated, not entirely functional, and was my first real embedded project, so it's real rough around the edges. It's mostly just here for others to pick apart for learning.
