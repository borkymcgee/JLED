# JLED
Arduino-based webserver for controlling individually addressable strips. Mostly just a personal project that i abandoned when i discovered WLED


This code is not actively updated, not entirely functional, and was my first real embedded project, so it's real rough around the edges. It's mostly just here for others to pick apart for learning.
